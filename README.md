## build.bat

`build.bat` is a script to easily prepare releases for your plugin, both classic and netf. Syntax is:

`build.bat [ASF_version_to_use]`

If started without arguments it will build plugin for latest asf version (please note, this can be a pre-release!). If `ASF_version_to_use` is specified, it will build for this version. 
Example: `build.bat 4.2.0.1`
